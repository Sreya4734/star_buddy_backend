Name: Moon. Type: moon. Constellation: Aur. Azimuth Angle: 306.5370880919918 degrees. Altitude Angle: 58.40598261789971 degrees. Description: The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384399 km (238,854 mi; about 30 times Earth's diameter). Because the Earth's gravitational pull has synchronized the Moon's rotation period (lunar day) with its orbital period (lunar month) of 29.5 Earth days, the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. The Moon's pull on Earth is the main driver of Earth's tides.
